    <h3>My Background</h3>
    <p>I am Lisa Oloo.I was born into a family of two, but my sister passed on. I am a writer, student and a mother. I cleared my high school education in 2011 and went to Egerton University. However, I did not like the course I was called to pursue. Even though I tried my best, I eventually dropped out of the course in 2nd year to pursue other interests. I now write for a living and I want to pursue coding because I like the idea of being a creator.</p>
